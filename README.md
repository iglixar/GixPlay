## Rooms (Shared Listening)

Gixplay includes a **real-time shared room feature** that allows multiple users to listen together.

### How Rooms Work

- Users enter a **display name** (stored locally on their device)
- A room can be **created or joined using a short code**
- Any participant can:
  - Paste a YouTube URL
  - Start playback
  - Pause or resume the current track
  - Add songs to the queue

There is **no host system** — every participant has equal control.

### Playback Sync

- The currently playing track
- Playback state (play / pause)
- Seek position
- Queue order

are synchronized across all connected devices in real time.

If one user:
- Changes the track
- Seeks to a new timestamp
- Pauses or resumes playback  

All connected devices update automatically.

### Queue System

- If a track is already playing, newly added tracks go into a shared queue
- When the current song ends, the next track auto-plays
- If no song is playing, users can manually select a queued track to start playback

### Live Activity Log

- Actions like *“played a song”*, *“added to queue”*, *“paused playback”* appear in a live log
- Each user name is color-coded consistently
- Logs exist only for the session and are not permanently stored
