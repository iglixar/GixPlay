</div>

### How Rooms Work

- Enter a **display name** (saved locally)
- Create or join a room using a **short code**
- Paste a YouTube URL to play music instantly
- Everyone hears the **same track, same time**

### Real-Time Sync

- Track changes
- Play / pause
- Seek position
- Queue order

Everything syncs live across all devices.

No host.  
No permissions.  
Everyone is equal.

---

## Shared Queue System

- If a song is already playing → new songs go into queue
- When a song ends → next song auto-plays
- If no song is playing → anyone can tap a queued song to start

Smooth, simple, and conflict-free.

---

## Live Activity Log

- See who played what
- Who added to queue
- Who paused or skipped

Each user name gets a **consistent random color**  
Logs are session-only and never stored permanently.
